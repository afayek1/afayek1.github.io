	        <h2>An Introduction to JavaScript</h2>
		        <p id="date">September 14, 2014</p>
		        <p>JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development. Unlike many languages, it was designed to be simple so that even nonprofessionals could use it. As a result, JavaScript has been criticized in the past as a language for “amateurs,” but more recently, as it’s strengths have become more clear, many “professionals” have developed tools and frameworks to leverage these strengths.</p>
		        <p>JavaScript is most commonly used to add client-side (code that runs in our browser as opposed to the server) behavior to HTML pages. In addition, because JavaScript can run on a client’s browser, the browser can respond quickly to users actions. Aside from adding stylistic features, one common behavior accomplished by using JavaScript is through a technique called AJAX. Through AJAX, content is added to websites without having to reload a page, for example, you can send a tweet through twitter without having to reload your page every time.</p>
		        <p>Unfortunately, like all programming languages, JavaScript too has its flaws. One example is a result of JavaScript’s emphasis on speed (people on the internet hate waiting). As a loosely typed language, JavaScript is considered “forgiving” because it reduces its emphasis on error checking for faster execution, and through this process comes the introduction of bugs. But like all languages, this can be countered by using sound coding practices and implementing plugins to catch these mistakes early on.</p>
