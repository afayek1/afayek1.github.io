        <h1>DBC Expectations</h1> <!--Title of Blog Post-->
        <h3>September 2, 2014</h3><!--Date-->
        <p>
        I am excited about my future at DBC for many reasons. First, I am excited to start this journey with people as like minded and passionate as myself. In addition, with a $12k price tag, people will be working harder than they ever have in their life. Second, I will be learning from the best. People with a vast array of backgrounds, including my peers, who will be able to share their inputs - essentially a bank of knowledge. And finally, I will be in an environment that promotes hard work and sanity (ie. forcing people to leave at 2AM, no coding during lunch, etc…). Pulling all-nighters is one of my favorite pastimes, but that said, I’m an extrovert, and my social life is something I value highly.
