        <h2>My Three Favorite Websites Right Now and their UX</h2> <!--Title of Blog Post-->
	       <p id='date'>September 2, 2014</p><!--Date-->
	       <h3><a href="http://airbnb.com/">airbnb</a></h3>
		      <p>This site is never content with how awesome it is and it always seems to be getting better. The simplicity of the site allows me to focus on how desperately I want to visit some places instead of how much I hate the site. Recently, or at least since the last time I visited the site, they added looping video of some of their locations. Normally, I hate auto-play videos, but airbnb has done it in a way that is not annoying. The video doesn't seem to make the site any slower despite its high quality, there is no sound to startle you, and because it's running in the background, I can't accidentally click it. Additionally, the usability is phenomenal. They provide auto-complete boxes that actually work and if I just want to browse, I can do so without filling in all the fields (ie. I can just look at places in New Orleans without knowing when I want to go, how many people, etcâ€¦ and filter after). For these reasons and more, this is probably my favorite website.</p>
			 <h3><a href="http://amazon.com/">Amazon</a></h3>
		       <p>Usually I'm just buying things from Amazon which is straightforward, but the other day, I needed to get in and change some account settings. That's when things got a bit frustrating. Amazon provides dropdowns, however, they are so long, it almost makes sense to have a single button that brings you to a page you can then navigate from. In addition, with buttons and pictures scattered everywhere, their site makes it difficult to focus on a task other than buying something (maybe that's their point?). In the end, while it didn't take too long to accomplish what I needed to, the experience wasn't pleasant and a good takeaway in UX.</p>
			 <h3><a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">Dev Bootcamp</a></h3>
		       <p>
		          Even though I will be attending Dev Bootcamp in October, bias aside, it's one of my favorite websites. The information on the site is broken down neatly, with different tabs and sections within those tabs. The graphics are informative, and through their use, prevent an abundance of text. On the other hand, when ample text is needed, such as in the FAQ page, it is broken up effectively to reduce any overwhelming sense. Overall, from the way information is provided to the details in colors and shadows, the site is just eloquent.
