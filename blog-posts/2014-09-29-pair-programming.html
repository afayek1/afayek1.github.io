        <h2>Pair Programming: The Good and the Bad</h2>
          <p id='date'>September 29, 2014</p>
            <p>Pair programming has its pros and cons. On one hand it can be rewarding, on the other frustrating. For the most part, I think whether you consider one to outweigh the other depends on your own experience and skill level. But here are my thoughts…</p>
              <h3>The Good</h3>
                <p>For me, pairing provides two things I am fond of: team work and “moments.” First, while some find a partner as competition, I tend to think of the assignment at hand as the competition. I attribute this to having spent most of my life competing in team sports. I am fine feeling vulnerable and asking for help, I am careful to make sure my partner understands something before I move on, and I enjoy the grind (figuratively and coffee). Second, pairing provides something I can only describe as “moments.” Far from the romantic kind, these are the nerdiest of kinds. The “ooo’s,” “woah’s,” and “yes’s!” The moments when your partner breaks out some sweet ninja code you will be stealing from then on, the moments when you finally find the source of a bug, complete your assignment, or figure something out together, and the moments where, yes, even you, break out some ninja code.</p>
              <h3>The Bad</h3>
                <p>A reoccurring notion I found on forums is that many people feel weighed down by pairing and find it inefficient. While there are times when you may pair with someone who is far below your skill level, the more likely scenario is that they are average, or possibly even better! I’ll shamefully admit that I sometimes feel the same way, but again, with sports as my influence, I have learned how to turn such experiences into a positive one. A leader doesn’t shun someone they feel less skillful. They instead feed their strengths and work with them to improve themselves. In the end, if you’re working together, you’re also working towards the same goal, so your mindset should switch from “you’re holding me back” to “what can I do to make this person better.” It’s easier said than done, but I think it’s a feeling much of the tech industry needs to adopt.</p>
