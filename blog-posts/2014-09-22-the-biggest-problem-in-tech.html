        <h2>Problems in Tech</h2>
          <p id="date">September 22, 2014</p>
          <p>We are ignoring our social responsibility. Worst of all, we are ignoring those who have little means to control their destiny. Kids.</p>
          <p>The bay area is home to many of the wealthiest companies and people in the world, yet it is also home to some of the worst schools in the United States, and many of the worst schools in the state. The worst part is, those with a voice, those with power, don’t seem to care. Have you ever seen affluent parents picketing for better education? What is the tech community doing to help? Why are almost 50 schools in the Bay Area in the bottom 5% of schools in California <sup><a href="http://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/pl/tier1.asp" >1</a></sup>.</p>
          <p>I am not sure what the best way to fix these problems are. Many of our problems are engrained in our society. Why, for example, do we focus so much on sending our kids to the “best” schools rather than have them become leaders at other schools? Or better yet, by having them at these other schools, then demand more resources and opportunities.</p>
          <p>The implications for solving these problems go beyond moral justice. For example, companies often complain there are not enough qualified people in the technology industry, yet we live at the world’s technology hub, with resources few places have to train generations upon generations of young students. People should be flocking from all over the world to attend any of our schools, not fighting over a mere handful. Frankly, it’s embarrassing, yet we seem to do a good job of ignoring it.</p>
