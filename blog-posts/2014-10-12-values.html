        <h2>"Do You"</h2>
        <p id='date'>October 12, 2014</p>

        <p>“Do you” is a phrase thrown around in Baltimore a lot. There are multiple meanings, but to me, it means be yourself, do what you feel is best for you, do what makes you happy.</p>

        <p>The reason I’ve decided to talk about this, is that in today’s world, we are bombarded with stories of success (ex. the news, social media, etc…) and we get caught up in it. My decision to attend Dev Bootcamp and become a software developer despite my public health degree has been questioned, but when did making a career change at 25 become so drastic?</p>

        <p>Here’s a quick story. A friend of mine was torn between going back to do a second undergraduate degree en route to working in an industry he actually enjoyed vs. continuing to work. The dilemma was due to the perceived success of many of our friends, and going back to school would mean living like an undergraduate again - and not the friend picking up the tab at the bar. I more or less forced my friend to go back to school, and needless to say, he is much happier now.</p>
