        <h2>Conflict Resolution</h2>
        <p id='date'>October 18, 2014</p>

        <p>Conflicts are part of everyday life. They may make you angry, mad, embarrassed, or any number of feelings, and that’s ok. In fact, these feelings are normal, and if you’re feeling them, the person on the other side is likely feeling them as well. Thus, the most important part of conflict resolution is how do deal with these feeling appropriately. Below I will explain a conflict I had to deal with in the past and some of the techniques I used to resolve it.</p>

        <p>Immediately after college, I began working for a friend’s metal recycling company. My job required me to manage people much older than me, with more experience, and who believed I got the job because I was the boss’ friend. Naturally, there was a lot of turbulence at first, but knowing how to deal with this conflict was instrumental to my success.</p>

        <h3>Understand the Other side</h3>

        <p>In any situation, it’s important to understand what the conflict is in order to fix it. Sometimes it’s easy and sometimes it’s not. In my case, it was easy. I understood that there was some resentment towards me because I was young and inexperienced and that others felt they deserved the position. I was a 22 year old telling people in their 40s what to do. Comparatively, I knew nothing compared to some who who had been working in the industry their whole lives, yet I was the one making the decisions. So I knew I had to prove that there was more to a job than age, for example, leadership.</p>

        <h3>Getting your Hands Dirty</h3>

        <p>Nobody is above anyone. And sometime you have to point that out. The industry I worked in was labor intensive, not many people had degrees, and the notion was more or less that I had soft hands. But I had no problem jumping in and doing the same tasks as everyone else, and when you are working 8+ hours a day in 100 degree weather moving things that weigh a couple tons, especially when you don’t have to, people tend to respect that.</p>

        <h3>Getting your Hands Dirty</h3>

        <p>Not everyone can handle being reamed. It can be pretty embarrassing, and as a result, it’s easy to retreat, yell back, or point fingers. DON’T DO THIS (Obviously if there is something threatening your job you need to speak up). In one instance, someone I was managing broke a piece of expensive equipment. It was an honest mistake that could have happened to anyone, and I could tell the person’s embarrassment more than made up for their mistake. Instead I took the blame, and people took note.</p>

        <p>Resolving conflicts is easier said than done, and for some it is much more inherent. But that’s ok too! Learning to deal with conflicts requires ongoing development. I hope this blog was able to help with that.</p>
