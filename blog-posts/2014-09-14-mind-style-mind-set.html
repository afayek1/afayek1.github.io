        <h3>Mindstyles and Mindsets</h3>
        <h4>September 14, 2014</h4>

        <p>By analyzing the way our own minds work, we can leverage it’s strengths while exploiting it’s weaknesses. To illustrate this, I will let you into my mind **insert alien theme music** by analyzing the way my own mind works based on two theories proposed by Anthony Gregorc and Carol Dweck.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Gregorc categorizes the way the mind works into four categories: Concrete Sequential, Concrete Random, Abstract Sequential, and Abstract Random. Normally, people tend to lean towards concrete or abstract and sequential or random, but I somehow fall in between an even mix of abstract sequential and abstract random. As an abstract random thinker, I strive in unstructured, people oriented environments while as an abstract sequential thinker I enjoy thinking about concepts and analyzing information. On the other hand, I have found that because of this, my instructions sometimes lack the details other strive on, i.e. concrete thinkers who prefer structured environments, and sometimes I feel I haven’t had enough time to research a particular topic. This is where Dweck’s theory comes in.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Dweck believes people assume a fixed mindset or a growth mindset. While people with fixed mindsets believe their traits are fixed, people with growth mindsets believe the opposite. As someone with a growth mindset, I find my own imperfections a learning opportunity. As I mentioned above, my instructions sometimes lack clarity. At work, a method I learned to counter this was to have people repeat back what I said or send me an email of what they think I said. To counter the frustration of not having enough time, I try to focus on completing the task at hand, then perfecting it later.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Hopefully this gave you a good introduction on how you can analyze your own mind. I’ll expand on this post later with more examples, so make sure to check back on this post later!</p>
